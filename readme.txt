REAL C++ CONTROLS IN YOUR APP!!!

Do you know the code "Real C++ Buttons" by Randy Mcdowell?
It sends a message to a VB Button to make it a "C++ Button". But if you look at this button with
Spy++ you will see that it is still a "ThunderCommandButton", the VB Button.

My code lets you use EVERY C++ control in your app!!! And these controls are REAL C++ controls!!!

Think of the fantastic controls you can have: e.g. the cool hotkey control. Or what about a "real"
RICHEDIT control? The only limitation is your fantasy! Control events are also supported.

Well commented, and easy to use even if you don't understand everything that happens.

Have fun with this code, use it in your app, and if you like it VOTE FOR IT!!!
